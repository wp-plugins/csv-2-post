			<h3>Engineer Notes</h3>
			<div class="inside">
            <p>I put this list together to ensure that I do not forget a single idea that users or myself have come up with.
            If a request is made I always add it to this list. When I'm working on the plugin I make a decision on what
            is priority based on the current status of the plugin and each upgrades level of demand.</p>
            
            <h4>2011 Planned Upgrades</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Interface Configuration: enhance use of questions and answers system before far more advanced features added</li>
              <li>Ensure reset is being done on importing, when file is newer than the original AND no data exists in project table. User may delete project data to restart. It should reset progress counters but they may not use the plugin to do it. We will double check on the main events, the status of current file data, progress and by which file date the progress belongs too. Review this.</li>
              <li>New File Checking: improve new file checking going by the time delay set in speed profile and the switch set on project Updating settings</li>
              <li>Post Test: provide a button in the test results to visit the post tested and a button to reset the project (delete the post)</li>
              <li>Images: ability to import images to the Wordpress library during importing or as a sub-process to reduce workload</li>
              <li>Tokens &amp; Custom Fields: ability to use a design of tokens for a single meta value</li>
              <li>Publish Date: option for it to be updated during update events, currentlt most users do not want this</li>
              <li>Duplicates: option to delete posts if they are a match and in the trash, will happen during testing</li>
              <li>Options Arrays: use array functions to check for individual values not yet installed, do this during activation</li>
              <li>Have a 24 hour check for records not use and indicate this on project overview, that posts can still be created</li>
              <li>Old Data: option to delete or private posts when their data record is not changed after an update, indicating it is no longer in the csv file. In some cases this indicates that a product is no longer available.</li>
              <li>Ensure all event actions update the projects speed profile action value to track what type of action happened.</li>
              <li>Apply&nbsp;$wpdb-&gt;flush(), establish where it would benifit script speed and clear caches.</li>
              <li>Put date stamp of csv file into data table per record, can be used to search the table for records not updated by new files.</li>
              <li>Count sql insert or update error/fails and prevent looping after 5, allowing some to be shown for debugging but preventing spamming.</li>
              <li>Speed Profiles: we require settings to determine if plugin should allow all action types to happen at once or alternate them</li>
              <li>Posts Created: we need a value for Project Posts Existing and Posts Created, if user deletes any project posts the Posts Created value is not accurate but is required to indicate creation progress.</li>
              <li>If no custom fields were setup at all, don't do any checks for custom&nbsp;fields during post creation or updating.</li>
              <li>Categorising: categorise using condition of giving values within selected column, any column.</li>
              <li>Server: apply maximum time limits with options to ignore it, in all major procedures</li>
              <li>Delete Posts Manually: use do_action() to update project table, new column that indicates row not to be used for any reason. This reason being that user delete the post as it is not required. Option for activating this to be provided.</li>
              <li>Data Functions: more options to generate or import keywords,tags and excerpt for all in one seo etc</li>
            </ol>
