Fat Ollie's Book: A Novel of the 87th Precinct,Fat Ollie's Book: A Novel of the 87th Precinct,"Murders happen every day in the big bad city. They're not such a big deal, you know. Even when the victim is a city councilman as well known as Lester Henderson. But this is the first time Fat Ollie Weeks of the 88th Precinct has written a novel, ah yes. Called Report to the Commissioner, it follows a cunning detective named Olivia Wesley Watts, who, apart from being female and slim, is rather like Fat Ollie himself.   While Ollie's responding to the squeal about the dead councilman, his leather dispatch case is stolen from the back of his car - and in it, the only copy of his precious manuscript. Joined by Carella and Kling from the neighboring 87th Precinct, Ollie investigates the homicide with all the exquisite crudeness, insensitivity, and determination for which he is famous.   But the theft of his first novel fills Ollie with a renewed passion for old-fashioned detective work. Following the exploits of one of Ed McBain's most beloved detectives, this lively and complicated novel - the fifty-second in the award-winning 87th Precinct series - is perhaps his best book yet.",http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3424014-10281551?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebooks.com%2Fcj.asp%3FIID%3D143705,http://us-preview.ebooks.com/previews/000/000143/000143705/000143705-sml-1.jpg,87th Precinct Series,"Burke, Jan",Fat Ollie's Book: A Novel of the 87th Precinct,Simon & Schuster,ebook
A Rage to Kill and & Other True Cases,A Rage to Kill and Other True Cases,"Acclaimed for her ""devastatingly accurate insight"" (The New York Times Book Review) into the criminal mind, Ann Rule has chronicled the most fascinating cases of our time in her bestselling Crime Files series. For this sixth stunning collection, Rule has culled from her private files the most-asked-about homicide cases - riveting accounts of seemingly normal men and women who are compelled d by a murderous rage to suddenly lash out at innocent victims.   Torn from the headlines, here is the case that shocked a nation: the Seattle city bus ride that turned to mayhem and murder at the hands of a gunman. Ann Rule unmasks the forces that drove quiet, clean-cut Silas Cool to shoot the driver, causing the bus to plunge off the Aurora Bridge into an apartment building. The catastrophe left three dead - including Cool - and dozens injured. While the scene unfolds as in a terrifying movie, Rule finds very real answers to the haunting question ""how could this happen?"" - and expertly constructs the unseen chain of events that resulted in an explosive and shattering tragedy.   Included here are nine other sensational cases that illuminate Rule's unique and authoritative view of the human psyche gone temporarily berserk. No one can match Rule's meticulous research, or reveal the motives to murder in such explicit and chilling detail. You may think you know who is safe and who is dangerous; in A Rage to Kill, Ann Rule frighteningly shows that none of us are truly protected from the flashes of irrational violence that can erupt from the killers among us.",http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-3424014-10281551?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebooks.com%2Fcj.asp%3FIID%3D138575,http://us-preview.ebooks.com/previews/000/000138/000138575/000138575-sml-1.jpg,Ann Rule's Crime Files,"Rule, Ann",A Rage to Kill and Other True Cases,Simon & Schuster,ebook
"Seriation, Stratigraphy, and Index Fossils","Seriation, Stratigraphy, and Index Fossils","Stratigraphic excavation is perhaps the best known of the various relative-dating methods used by prehistorians. Although there are several techniques of using artifacts from superposed strata to measure time, these are rarely if ever differentiated. Rather, common practice is to categorize them under the heading `stratigraphic excavation'. This text distinguishes among the several techniques and argues that stratigraphic excavation tends to result in discontinuous measures of time - a point little appreciated by modern archaeologists.",http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-3424014-10281551?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebooks.com%2Fcj.asp%3FIID%3D196836,http://us-preview.ebooks.com/previews/000/000196/000196836/000196836-sml-1.jpg,Archaeology,"Lyman, R.Lee","Seriation, Stratigraphy, and Index Fossils",Springer,ebook

Archaeology and Created Memory,Archaeology and Created Memory,"Archaeology can either bolster memory and tradition, or contradict the status quo and provide an alternative view of the past. An archaeology of Harpers Ferry's wartime and Victorian eras confronts time-honoured historical interpretations of the past (created and perpetuated by such interest groups as historians and the National Park Service) and in so doing allows us to be more inclusive of the town's forgotten histories and provides alternative voices to a past.",http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-3424014-10281551?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebooks.com%2Fcj.asp%3FIID%3D196987,http://us-preview.ebooks.com/previews/000/000196/000196987/000196987-sml-1.jpg,Archaeology,"Shackel, Paul A.",Archaeology and Created Memory,Springer,ebook
