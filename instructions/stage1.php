        <h2>Stage 1 Instructions</h2>
		<h3>Campaign Name</h3>
		<p>Enter a single word that will help you to identify the campaign later. You will need to remember it&nbsp;using the campaign management page.</p>
		<h3>Full Processing - WARNING! </h3>
<p>Full processing will inject all data all at once and many servers will react badly to this. Also in most cases you will receive a memory limit error which stops the full processing and will not actually work. I recommend setting up WordPress on your computer (localhost) and running the plugin from there. 
<h3>Staggered Processing</h3>
		<p>Staggered involves processing rows of data in your CSV files every time someone visits a page on your blog. For example if I visit your blog, 20 rows may be processed and so 20 new posts are instantly created. If I then go to another page, another 20 rows will be processed. This may take a while but should not cause issues with your server&nbsp;but it is still a possibility.</p>
		<h3>Local&nbsp;(FTP Uploaded)</h3>
		<p>Local  is the preferred method if your CSV files are above 2MB but it will require you to place your CSV file in the CSV 2 POST plung directory, specifically the &quot;csv_files&quot; folder. You then enter the full name including file extension (.csv) into the box provided above. </p>
		<h3>Upload</h3>
		<p>This will allow you to upload a CSV file but is limited to 2MB files. I recommend using this option for testing the plugin and getting to know it properly&nbsp;then learning how to upload your larger CSV files&nbsp;using FTP.</p>
