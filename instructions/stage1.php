        <h2>Stage 1 Instructions</h2>
		<h3>Campaign Name</h3>
		<p>Enter a single word that will help you to identify the campaign later.</p>
		<h3>Full Processing</h3>
<p>Full processing will inject all data all at once&nbsp;and is the best option however many servers will reacte badly to this. To process the entire file requires a &quot;Permanent Process&quot; which some hosting or servers are configured to block. This could mean that your website goes down for a period of time. If you are on free or reseller/shared server hosting then there is a high risk of&nbsp;this.<h3>Staggered Processing</h3>
		<p>Staggered involves processing rows of data in your CSV files every time someone visits a page on your blog. For example if I visit your blog, 5 rows may be processed and so 5 new posts ware instantly created. If I then go to another page, another 5 rows will be processed. This may take a while but should not cause issues with your server if you are on reseller or free hosting.</p>
		<h3>Link</h3>
		<p>Link is the preferred method if your CSV files are above 2MB but it will require you to place your CSV file somewhere in your blog&nbsp;and linking directly to it. Normally you would use an FTP service to do this. </p>
		<h3>Upload</h3>
		<p>This will allow you to upload a CSV file but is limited to 2MB files. I recommend using this option for testing the plugin and getting to know it properly&nbsp;then learning how to upload your larger CSV files&nbsp;using FTP.</p>
