<h2>Stage 2 Instructions</h2>
<h3>CSV Column Titles</h3>
<p>On the left you will see a list of the titles for your own CSV file. Before you continue you must know and understand what data each of these columns holds. You then need to consider what columns hold suitable data for parts of wordpress posts. If your data is flawed then so will your post and possible your campaign be.</p>
<h3>Select WordPress Post Parts</h3>
<p>The options in the drop down menus represent each part of a wordpress post or the meta data attached to the post&nbsp;i.e. information you do not alway see on your theme. You need to match the correct part of a post with the CSV column you think has suitable data. You can use the same CSV column more than once but it is not recommended in most scenarios. You can only use each &quot;Post Parts&quot; once or again it may cause problems.</p>
<p>Right now the only parts used in this plugin (you can ignore the rest for now) are as follows...</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>EXCLUDE</strong> - If you are not using one of your CSV columns select this</li>
  <li><strong>Title</strong> - Select this for a product name/title, usually 3-5 words&nbsp;in most cases.</li>
  <li><strong>Content</strong> - Match this to the column that has a description and is the largest chunk of text.</li>
  <li><strong>Image URL</strong> - If your data includes a column with links to images then match this to it.</li>
  <li><strong>Buy URL</strong> - This is a destination link&nbsp;i.e. sales page for affiliate product</li>
</ol>
<h3>Required</h3>
<p>The two require data parts are Title and Content. Failing to match them to a CSV column will have pretty poor results in this plugin right now. I suspect there may also be issues when you do not have Image URL's and Buy URL's in your data, in the current version. If you experiance any problems please contact ryan@webtechglobal.co.uk</p>
