<h2>Stage 3 Instructions</h2>
<h3>Publish</h3>
<p>Selecting this option will make all your new posts public straight away. This is the best option if you trust the content in your CSV file, you have testing this plugin works fine on your&nbsp;blog and&nbsp;your about to process hundreds of rows.</p>
<h3>Pending</h3>
<p>Pending indicates that publication is required and is usually the state a post is in when a member submits a&nbsp;post to your website. It is similiar to draft and will stop posts going public before you see them. Not a good idea if your about to process hundreds of rows unless you have the time to go through them all.</p>
<h3>Draft</h3>
<p>Normally the state that a post is in&nbsp;while it is still being written. If you want all your newly created posts to receive some sort of editing after creation you should select this. I recommend against it however if you plan to process hundreds of rows.&nbsp;If there is something you need to do manually to&nbsp;all posts please let me know&nbsp;so I can build a way to do it in this plugin.</p>
