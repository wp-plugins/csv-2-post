<h2>Stage 5 Instructions</h2>
<h3>Selected Filter Column</h3>
<p>If you have a column of data in your CSV file that can be used to categories the rows then that is the one you want to select from the list. A&nbsp;good example is if your data was on books. In the drop down menu you would select the &quot;Genre&quot; column or if your blog was all about authors and you used authors names for categories you could select &quot;Authors&quot;.&nbsp;In affiliate data you might have a column title named &quot;ADVERTISORS CATEGORY&quot; or one similiar&nbsp;which may also allow you&nbsp;to cateogries your posts.</p>
<p>Once you have decided on your column and selected it in the drop down menu you then need to establish ALL the unique values that your selected column has. I know this is not ideal but right now it is the best approach.</p>
<h3>Data Value</h3>
<p>This is the unique value you found in your selected csv file filter column. It must be copied and pasted or typed exactly as it is in your csv file else this will not work at all. Enter each unique value in a different box&nbsp;in order to complete the filter&nbsp;on all posts else some posts will be entered to your blogs default category.</p>
<h3>Category</h3>
<p>You will notice that the drop down menus hold a list of your categories. You now need to decide what &quot;Data Value&quot; will filter posts into which category. Using the book example I may have a category in my blog called &quot;Science Finction&quot; and I selected &quot;Genre&quot; as my &quot;Selected Filter Column&quot;. In my selected filter column there is a list genre's one of which says&nbsp;&quot;science-fic&quot;. I know this means science finction and so I enter &quot;science-fic&quot; in a Data Value box and then find &quot;Science Finction&quot; in my category list and select it.</p>
