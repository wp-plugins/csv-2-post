<h2>CSV 2 POST Free Edition  </h2>

<h3>Free/Trial Edition Restrictions</h3>
<p>This plugin is provided free of any charge but there are restrictions that increase during the use of this software. I have no doubt
whatsoever that if my plugin is used correctly it can increase site traffic, make you money and do a massive job for you. Well worth paying
for if you feel it is a key part of a project&nbsp;and you can buy the paid edition &quot;CSV 2 POST Plus&quot; <a href="http://www.webtechglobal.co.uk/wordpress-services/wordpress-plugins/csv-2-post-plus" title="CSV 2 POST Plus" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Get CSV 2 POST Plus Half Price!</h3>
<p>I'm offering bug hunters the chance to get CSV 2 POST half price, currently £15.99/$26.50.
 All you need to do is report  bugs you find that have not been found already and reported on the WebTechGlobal Forum. 
I also need to be able to witness the bug/error or create it myself and it must not be related specifically to your data.
Find two different bugs and I will give you CSV 2 POST Plus with 75% OFF! I suggest you send me screenshots and description of what you think triggered the error.</p>
<h3>Current Trial Restrictions</h3>
<p>These restrictions are relaxed more and more if people get involved in reporting problems, providing feedback and signing up to the forum. Such participation supports my website and in&nbsp;turn I try to give something back.</p>
