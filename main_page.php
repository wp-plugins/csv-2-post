<h2>CSV 2 POST  </h2>
<p>Thank you for installing CSV 2 POST, developed and released July 2009 by <a href="http://www.webtechglobal.co.uk/wordpress-services/wordpress-csv-2-post-plugin" title="Visit WebTechGlobal's Plugin Page" target="_blank">WebTechGlobal</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please read and fully understand all instructions before using this plugin for the first time</strong>. The plugin has a lot of power and will have a mass effect on your blog in a very short time. As with all plugins you use it at your own risk and the developer, myself, Ryan Bayne (WebTechGlobal), shares no responsbility for the outcome of its use.&nbsp;This is simply because it is impossible&nbsp;for me to know what data you are using and how you configure your campaign settings. When used correctly however this plugin will do an amazing job for you.</p>
<p>If there is anything your not 100% sure about  please email  <a href="mailto:wordpress@webtechglobal.co.uk">wordpress@webtechglobal.co.uk</a></p>
