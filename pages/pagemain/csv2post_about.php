<h4>Free Importer Core</h4>
<p>We have designed CSV 2 POST free edition as a quick start to anyone seeking to mass create posts. We provide 
options that most free importer plugins restrict. They do this to seem advanced and encourage sale of their premium
edition. They do it with features already built into Wordpress and all they are doing is not providing the full
benefits that Wordpress has to offer. CSV 2 POST main developer Ryan Bayne has spent months not only preparing a plugin that offers more than most
others do on the interface
but he has also ensured more is offered in the plugins core. Our plugin can be
adapted into anything a client requires and importantly there is innovation that developers will realize great potential in.</p>

<h4>First Auto-Blogging Data Engine</h4>
<p>CSV 2 POST is the first plugin to act as a Data Engine, not just an importer. Our plugin was the first and still is the only known plugin
to import data to the database before using it to create posts. This was updated April 2013. So 'what does this mean exactly?', you may be asking.
What it means is this plugin imports rows from a CSV file and puts them into none Wordpress tables. Your Wordpress installation is hardly effected
by the initial data import. You can focus on importing millions of rows if we wanted and worry about the rest later. You can work with the data in
endless ways, hours before mass creating posts. You can use other tools to prepare the data prior to making use of it. All of this ability is
offered in a 100% free plugin. Can you imaging what we provide in our premium edition? Developers see massive potential in our original and innovative
approaches. This leads to great support in terms of beta testing, advice and general feedback. However we could also make use of more donations to
deliver more features normally provided in premium plugins of this nature due to the high levels of support they generate.</p>
