                <p>There are plenty .csv file importers available for Wordpress. But most never went far enough.
                Most were designed for the average project and were a good starting point for developers
                to customize their own importer. CSV 2 POST was the first importer to go further and was created
                in 2009 by Ryan Bayne. Although the 
                the free edition is still very simple visually. It contains a large portion of the core required
                for the premium editions power. Automated data import, update, post creation, post update and more.
                All abilities in high demand, all delivered by CSV 2 POST in full for the first time by any importer
                on Wordpress. Importer plugins that follow are still trying to achieve what CSV 2 POST premium does
                but it is no easy task. This plugins advantage is that it was one of the first among all and is still
                being developed regularly. We are proud to continue updating the free edition and ensure it always
                has a use.</p>                    

                <p class="about-description">Author...</p>
                
                <p>My name is Ryan Bayne and I created CSV 2 POST not long after my first daughter was born
                and while still at University. What a crazy time that was let me tell you. I ended up studying
                Wordpress instead of University coursework because I seen the potential WP offers. Considering
                I had to secure my financial situation so I took a chance and focused more on WP than studying,
                it paid off. I seen a gap in the market for an import plugin when playing around with the idea of mass producing 
                pages. It was one of those moments where you get an idea and just for a moment you think you
                might be the first. We are all naive for a moment right but I quickly discovered auto-blogging
                in Wordpress was not just being done, it was being done in a big way and not being done well.
                I think I arrived on the scene just as data importing was heating up. Competition by other
                businesses who appear to have teams has been tough. But I'm still hear and I'm very far from finished
                with CSV 2 POST and WP data importing in general.</p>
