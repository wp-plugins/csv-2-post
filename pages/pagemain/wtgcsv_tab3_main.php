<p>Wordpress CSV Importer is the most advanced data import and post creation plugin created 2012. It will be supported
for many years. Users can import data, manage it then use newly created database tables in their post creation projects.</p>

<h4>Developed For Internet Professionals</h4>
<p>Experts in all areas of Web Design and Internet Development have helped to shape Wordpress CSV Importer. Their
requests related to SEO, data management and far more advanced features. Has ensured that Wordpress CSV Importer is on the 
right path to becoming the ultimate CSV importer for Wordpress. If your not using a plugin as advanced as Wordpress CSV Importer,
you have to ask yourself, 'Are you doing it the best way possible?'.</p> 

<h4>Free and Paid Editions</h4>
<p>It is my objective to create a free edition that offers a useful tool for data import and post creation. A goal
for the free edition is to offer a good starting point to anyone who seeks to create/customize a CSV importer to
suit their own specific needs. This will require a lot of documentation and explination of all features in detail. I
plan to create a blog page per panel shown on the plugins interface and a video for each even if just a short clip.</p>
<p>The paid edition offers more advanced and complicated features which would not only generate a lot of support
requests if giving free but some of them require SOAP Web Services to work. These running costs can only be covered
by selling a more advanced plugin, for complex projects. One of the biggest goals for the paid edition is to
reduce administration time for users by automating tasks they would normally do manually. Sometimes this requires
custom functions/features which is delivered as quick as possible.</p>
