CSV import plugins for the latest version of Wordpress. Adaptable autoblogging features included. Free and Pro edition supported daily. Users include Ryanair Ltd and the Trevithick Society.

== Description ==

Lets turn data into websites shall we. CSV 2 POST for Wordpress can import any .csv file then autoblog the data into hundreds or even thousands of well designed WP posts. 
My CSV importer plugin creates custom fields, categories and meta. If your new to Wordpress those are some of the elements that make up a web page in WP. 
CSV 2 POST is the first plugin to import data to a custom database table allowing the data to be prepared and other more advanced steps during the autoblogging procedure. 
Combine that with the power of Wordpress and there is no limit to how many high quality websites you can create using any data.

= Why CSV 2 POST? = 

You have a .csv file and you would like to see the contents turned into hundreds of posts. CSV 2 POST can do that for you. It will
also help you manage your posts long after they are created. My Wordpress data importer inserts your .csv file contents to
a custom database table first. CSV 2 POST was the first plugin to do this and it surprises many but there are many advantages
to this approach i.e. integration with other software, sharing the table (raw data) and not the data in WP tables which the
Wordpress core will change in many ways. Professionals need to keep an original, businesses need to do things in smaller steps
and always have a backup. CSV 2 POST does that and by doing so avoids major mistakes i.e. the wrong rows in .csv file being applied
to the wrong posts during updating. The pro edition of CSV 2 POST takes things even further and when donations come in I move
premium features into the free edition to be fair to the Wordpress community.

== Installation ==

1. You can place the csv-2-post folder in the plugins directory using FTP
1. You can also upload the plugin using Wordpress plugin screen (wp-admin/plugin-install.php)
1. If your Wordpress installation is on a path that includes "csv2post" it will trigger debugging to activate. This is meant for localhost development and can be disabled.
1. Your CSV file should be uploaded using FTP or Wordpress itself. Submit the path to CSV 2 POST, CSV 2 POST does not handle the upload. I have left this independent because there is security to consider for a lot of .csv files and the user should decide where best to store the file.
1. Please ensure wherever your .csv file is stored that Wordpress has permission to access the folder and file. Permissions can be changed in your hosting control panel for a directory. Developer software such as PhpED also allows it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I import CommissionJunction affiliate feeds? =
Firstly let me be clear that CSV 2 POST works with .csv files only. WebTechGlobal will be releasing other types of importers in time.
CSV files downloaded from C.J. affiliate network work great with this data importer plugin.

= Is there a limit to the number of posts I can create? =
No there are no limits anywhere. Let me know a plugin that has a limit for no reason other than generating premium sales and I'll
go to its page and rate it 1 star! 

= Will CSV 2 POST help me with SEO? = 
Yes CSV 2 POST includes features that makes good SEO easier to achieve. Version 8 of the free edition now allows unlimited number of
custom fields which can have very unique values designed using the WYSIWYG editor. It works in the same way as post title and post content.
Multiple columns of data can be inserted to create unique strings of text or even entire paragraphs.

= Why does the free editon have help text that only applies to premium edition? =
This is slowly being cleaned up. Some text is left in because it explains thing that helps users to understand how Wordpress works. Even
if it is based on a premium feature I hope it still helps someone. I welcome any requests to remove further mentions of a paid edition at
anytime. 

= Why are most videos based on the premium editions interface? =
Well as you can imaging creating and editing videos is time consuming. As features change videos need re-made so it is a constant job.
Most videos will cover all features in the free edition even if it takes a little longer because it has to cover options or procedures
only in the paid edition. However I'm more than happy to create YouTube tutorials on request.

= When was CSV 2 POST released? =
The project started in 2009 and was quickly backed by large businesses including Ryanair Ltd. I created the plugin while technically still at University so
it didn't take long for a re-development to happen. I found myself re-developing it again in 2014 with the aim of making more use of the Wordpress core. Version
8.0.0 should be the last big update of this free plugin which has been designed based on years of feedback. The premium will continue to expand.

= Is CSV 2 POST just like any-other .csv file importer for Wordpress? =

Innovation went into CSV 2 POST year one

= Is CSV 2 POST better than any other .csv file importer on Wordpress? =

If I said CSV 2 POST is "better" than any plugin of its kind on Wordpress it would simply be my opinion and a bias one at that. 
So lets be realistic and honest. You can bet most data importers for Wordpress are designed to do all the 
common and usual stuff. So I designed something different that is worth trying and supporting even if just a quick Tweet.

= What makes CSV 2 POST different from other importers? =

Possible better support as most free plugins lack support, sandbox style interface making it easy to customize, 
Wordpress styles used on the admin interface making it a better choice for developers to install in their clients blogs,
more video and test tutorials, less pushy sales tactics for our premium edition on both the free UI and the plugins 
portal, closer to client treatment than customer treatment even when coming to me for help as a free user.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

= Summary =

These are the rules followed to increase the CSV 2 POST plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

= When To Update = 

Update all plugins and themes...after you have made a copy of all your sites files and data. Files only or data only is not a
suitable backup. I recommend running updates when you have a free hour ahead of you to reverse the changes should anything go
wrong. This applies to all plugins and themes not just CSV 2 POST when updating on live blogs.
