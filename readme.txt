Adaptable data import plugin for professionals. Pro edition used by Ryanair Ltd, Trevithick Society and many more.

== Description ==

Lets turn data into websites! CSV 2 POST for Wordpress can import any .csv file (properly formatted) then autoblog the data into hundreds or even thousands of well designed WP posts. My CSV importer plugin creates custom fields, categories and meta. If your new to Wordpress those are some of the elements that make up a web page in WP. CSV 2 POST is the first plugin to import data to a custom database table allowing the data to be prepared and other more advanced steps during the autoblogging procedure. Combine that with the power of Wordpress and there is no limit to how many high quality websites you can create using any data.

= Why CSV 2 POST? = 

You have a .csv file and you would like to see the contents turned into hundreds of posts. CSV 2 POST can do that for you. It will
also help you manage your posts long after they are created. My Wordpress data importer inserts your .csv file contents to
a custom database table first. CSV 2 POST was the first plugin to do this and it surprises many but there are many advantages
to this approach i.e. integration with other software, sharing the table (raw data) and not the data in WP tables which the
Wordpress core will change in many ways. Professionals need to keep an original, businesses need to do things in smaller steps
and always have a backup. CSV 2 POST does that and by doing so avoids major mistakes i.e. the wrong rows in .csv file being applied
to the wrong posts during updating. The pro edition of CSV 2 POST takes things even further and when donations come in I move
premium features into the free edition to be fair to the Wordpress community.

== Installation ==

1. You can place the csv-2-post folder in the plugins directory using FTP
1. You can also upload the plugin using Wordpress plugin screen (wp-admin/plugin-install.php)
1. If your Wordpress installation is on a path that includes "csv2post" it will trigger debugging to activate. This is meant for localhost development and can be disabled.
1. Your CSV file should be uploaded using FTP or Wordpress itself. Submit the path to CSV 2 POST, CSV 2 POST does not handle the upload. I have left this independent because there is security to consider for a lot of .csv files and the user should decide where best to store the file.
1. Please ensure wherever your .csv file is stored that Wordpress has permission to access the folder and file. Permissions can be changed in your hosting control panel for a directory. Developer software such as PhpED also allows it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I import CommissionJunction affiliate feeds? =
Download .csv files from Commission Junction then upload them or paste a URL directly to a .csv file on any domain to import it that way.
Commission Junction and all other affiliate networks are supported. 

= Is there a limit to the number of posts I can create? =
There are no limits others than what your server will allow you to do in a single request. There are also more features
in CSV 2 POST free edition than most (possibly all) .csv importers. Things like features images and permalinks are withheld
in other free editions to encourage premium sale. I rely on people purchasing CSV 2 POST pro to either show their gratitide for
my hundreds of hours unpaid work on the project.

= Will CSV 2 POST help me with SEO? = 
Yes CSV 2 POST allows the creation of post meta (custom fields) which are used by most SEO solutions. More support can be added on
request for free.

= Why does the free editon have help text that only applies to premium edition? =
The plugin has a help system which stores help text. The help system includes tools on WebTechGlobal to manage a projects
documentation. Right now I do not have the time to write free edition versions as my time on this project is not paid.

= Why are most videos based on the premium editions interface? =
This is a one man project and this one man does not earn a lot. I just can't find the hours in the day to create two videos for each page systematically but I'm still
happy to take requests.

= When was CSV 2 POST released? =
The project started in 2009 and was quickly backed by large businesses including Ryanair Ltd. I created the plugin while technically still at University so
it didn't take long for a re-development to happen. I found myself re-developing it again in 2014 with the aim of making more use of the Wordpress core. Version
8.0.0 should be the last big update of this free plugin which has been designed based on years of feedback. The premium will continue to expand.

= Is CSV 2 POST just like any-other .csv file importer for Wordpress? =

I spent months perfecting my design and creating a very different auto-blogging plugin. It has a sand-box approach designed to
act like a set of tools. As the plugin gains more support this collection of tools will grow.

= Is CSV 2 POST better than any other .csv file importer on Wordpress? =

If I said CSV 2 POST is "better" than any plugin of its kind on Wordpress it would simply be my opinion and a bias one at that. 
So lets be realistic and honest. You can bet most data importers for Wordpress are designed to do all the 
common and usual stuff. So I designed something different that is worth trying and supporting even if just a quick Tweet.

= What makes CSV 2 POST different from other importers? =

Possible better support as most free plugins lack support, sandbox style interface making it easy to customize, 
Wordpress styles used on the admin interface making it a better choice for developers to install in their clients blogs,
more video and test tutorials, less pushy sales tactics for our premium edition on both the free UI and the plugins 
portal, closer to client treatment than customer treatment even when coming to me for help as a free user.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

= Summary =

These are the rules followed to increase the CSV 2 POST plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

= When To Update = 

Update all plugins and themes...after you have backedup all your sites files and data. Files only or data only is not a
suitable backup. I recommend running updates when you have a free hour ahead of you to reverse the changes should anything go
wrong.
