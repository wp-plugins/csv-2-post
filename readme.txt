Created by Ryan Bayne from WebTechGlobal, import csv data, publish to WordPress as posts, auto custom fields, auto category creation and sorting. 

== Description ==

Import any data with far more ease than any other import plugin because you don't need to name columns anything specific and your columns can be in any order!
This is not an adaptation of Import CSV, WordPress DataFeed Import or any other csv import plugin. All code an interface is totally unique and I have never used another csv import plugin. CSV 2 POST is my first plugin
and it was the result of a data import script for getting affiliate data to WordPress. Somehow being new to WordPress and creating my very first plugin I ended
up with a product 3 months later called CSV 2 POST PLUS which is even better and growing daily.
