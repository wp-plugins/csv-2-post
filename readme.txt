Created by Ryan Bayne from WebTechGlobal, import csv data, publish to WordPress as posts, auto custom fields, auto category creation and sorting. 

== Description ==

CSV Import plugin developed by <a href="http://www.webtechglobal.co.uk/about" title="Visit WebTechGlobal Home">Ryan Bayne</a>.

Import any data with far more ease than any other import plugin because you don't need to name columns anything specific and your columns can be in any order!
This is not an adaptation of Import CSV. All code an interface is totally unique and I have never used another csv import plugin. CSV 2 POST is my first plugin
and it was the result of a data import script for getting affiliate data to WordPress. Somehow being new to WordPress and creating my very first plugin I ended
up with a product 3 months later called CSV 2 POST PLUS which is even better and growing daily. Demo available at www.csv2post.com

<h3>CSV 2 POST PLUS</h3>
The paid edition of this plugin is aimed at those who import data as part of their job or longer term ambitions. It allows custom
layouts to be created and customisation can be applied easily for every customer. I offer this service free and will even help you
import the data if your short on time.

The paid edition also has far more control over SEO, Tags, Custom Fields, Categorising and general configuration. Try the demo on the official website.
