CSV 2 POST

== Description ==

CSV 2 POST is a growing box of tools for auto-blogging and managing imported data. 
Everything added to this plugin is at the request of users who know best including professionals developing true money 
making websites and even well known companies have made use of CSV 2 POST to help with administration. Those
include CBS News and Ryanair Ltd. They come to us because
other plugins which offer a step by step system and assume a lot about what the user wants done with their data
are simply not good enough. 

CSV 2 POST has been designed to out-perform other importers and we have done that with the help of the Wordpress
community who use them all. We include a step-by-step system like most (possibly all) other plugins available,
which takes users through the same process on every single use, every single website no matter what theme or plugins
we use. However our main interface is more of a workshop or a sandbox and in this sandbox are endless tools, some
are not obvious because it's hard putting them all on one interface without making it feel over complicated.

= Support = 
The plugin is supported by a dedicated
website at [www.csv2post.com](http://www.csv2post.com/). The interface offers a "Help" button beside every feature. A small hint 
is giving and users can click another button to open a page on www.csv2post.com specific to the feature
the user needs help for. Some pages will have video tutorials and screenshots. The online support content is free. We
also plan to create help content specifically for the free edition so that it is truly supported.

= Our Mission =
It is very important to us that we deliver a useful free plugin for the Wordpress community to use and not
deliver software that behaves like a trial in order to advertise our paid edition. To ensure we do not make that
mistake as we have done before, we encourage all potential customers who email us to try the free edition, unless
thier project is unique and requires changes to the plugin. We have a very long term plan for CSV 2 POST, both free 
and paid. Most of the time a new feature begins on the free edition and grows in the paid edition. This is how
we ensure full respect to Wordpress is giving. If you budget is tight just say

== Installation ==

Initial upload and activation as guided by Wordpress.org standard plugin installation.

1. Upload the `csv-2-post` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the CSV 2 POST plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin by going to the Settings screen
1. Always backup your database before mass creating posts unless working on a test blog
1. It is recommended you learn the plugin on a test blog first
1. Always seek support if a CSV file does not appear to work, it is usually something minor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with SEO by Yoast plugin? =
Yes it does, actually in a technical way all SEO plugins work with CSV 2 POST however
the most popular get some extra support to make it easier for users. That includes All In One SEO 
and we will add the extra support for any other plugins on request.

= Is CSV 2 POST well supported? =
Yes, the plugin will be supported for many years and has a dedicated website.

= Will you make changes to the plugin to suit my needs? =
We note every request on a "To Do" list and we intend to keep working through the list
every week. If your needs are more urgent we can be hired. It is mainly Ryan Bayne who 
handles the more complex requests. However sometimes we can add a new feature to the free
edition quickly so please push for the free option first.

= Will development continue for this plugin? =
Our To Do list for CSV 2 POST is already extensive. Ideas, requests and
requirements for new web technology will keep us busy until 2014. This is why the plugins
interface has so many screens and offers the ability to hide features not wanted. 

= Why are the features on so many different plugin screens? =
Long term plans for the development of CSV 2 POST will add an endless list
of new features. Not only do all the form fields and buttons need to be tidy but
every feature and ability has to be offered without assumption. Meaning users
must be able to configure them or opt out of using them or use defaults. Users have that
choice and flexability which is not offered in all plugins. The entire plugin offers a 
sandbox approach, especially for those who know a little PHP and can customise it even
further. The sandbox approach assumes nothing and is expressed on an interface that does
not push users through a linear step by step process.

= When was CSV 2 POST Beta released? =
This plugins re-development begun at the end of 2011 and the Beta was released June 2012. However the
first plugin was created in 2009 and was halted pending re-development.

== Screenshots ==

1. Start by creating a Data Import Job and import your CSV files data to a new database table created by CSV 2 POST. We have the potential here to import to existing tables and more.
2. Create templates for placing your data into post content. Templates are stored under a custom post type so many templates can be created. This gives us the potential to apply different designs based on specific conditions.
3. You can even create title templates, so you do not need pre-made titles, just suitable columns of data to create a title string from. These templates are stored under a custom post type.
4. Set the type of posts you want to create. Many plugins and themes will require you to create a different type of post, something CSV 2 POST will do easily.
5. This screenshot shows "Basic Custom Field Rules", paid edition has advanced features but most users require the basic form which allows you to create post meta with any data.
6. You can use up to 3 columns of data to create 3 levels of categories.

    * Installation improvements
    * Menu improvement that fixes a newly introduced bug. Main page tab screens were merged into one. The actual reason why this started happening on the main page and not others is still not known.

* Feature Changes
    * ECI: part one notice now explains to the user that they should complete the ECI process now before working on other data import jobs if they intend to finish their current ECI project. This is required due to the "Current Default Data Import Job" or "Current Default Data Import Project" which the plugin stores in order to configure the interface per project and avoid the user needing to switch between them.
    * ECI: added notice confirming content template created or not on failure
* Technical Changes
    * csv2post_include_form_processing_php() moved from page load functions to csv2post.php in attempt to processing post submission earlier and improve the loaded page based on changes made during processing.

= 6.7.4 =
* From The Developers
    * Hope everyone has a Happy 2013 and we wish you all success in your Wordpress ventures
* New Features
    * A new Easy CSV Importer screen/system has been added and is in a BETA phase 
    * Added a 'Screen Permissions' panel on Interface Settings screen for configuring the Wordpress ability a user requires to view screens (individual screen abilities can be selected). This is feature was added more for the long term use of the plugins core to create other plugins but still a good feature to have.
    * Plugin update/upgrade system. This will prompt user to initiate an upgrade process which in most cases will do nothing apart from update the blog with a record of the current version for comparison later. The intended purpose of this new system is to alter the plugins installation in some way when it is required, in a controlled way with warning to the user.  
* Support Changes
    * Not this time, we are not ready to deply support services or material until the plugins rate of change slows down a little
* Fixes
    * Post Author menu fixed
    * Problems saving admin settings (default settings kept being re-installed and cause was in csv2post_get_option_adminsettings()
    * Using remove_action() to prevent Comprehensive Google Map Plugin causing a jQuery UI conflict breaking the CSV 2 POST interface
    * Undefined Variable when no projects created yet, (not critical) Warning would be caused in csv2post_event_action() when the projects array is used in a foreach loop. Simply by passing it now when there are no projects.
    * Notice: Undefined variable: fulledition_filename (not critical)
    * Warning: Missing argument 2 for wpdb::prepare(), called in /home/buyusedc/public_html/wp-content/plugins/csv-2-post/templatesystem/include/csv2post_WP_SQL_functions.php on line 312. Fixed by removing prepare from csv2post_query_insert_new_record().
    * csv2post_drop_dataimportjob_table() no longer causes error when dropping data import table AFTER $csv2post_jobtable_array option record has been deleted. This is a scenario during un-installing the plugin including for re-install.  
    * Warning: array_rand() expects parameter 1 to be array, boolean given in /home/sites/games-hq.com/public_html/testing/csv2post672/wp-content/plugins/csv-2-post/fulledition/csv2post_automation_functions.php on line 449. The schedule now checks if $csv2post_jobtable_array is an array before going further during post update event. 
    * PHP Warning: unlink(/home/eosworld/public_html/wp-content/wpcsvimportercontent/csv2post_log_automation.csv). Causing function csv2post_logfile_autodelete() is being called in csv2post_log() before any check for files status. csv2post_logfile_autodelete() now checks if file exists before continuing.
    * Easy Configuration Questions fixed. This system is still in beta. The two current test questions are menus with single choice answers and they were not being populated properly, would throw an error if error display on.             
* Feature Changes
    * Notification values are now added to the options table during installation. These notifications are default persistent notifications that need to be deleted by user and they show on various places on the interface.
    * Notices boxes CSS has been improved to accomodate buttons on the notices
    * Extra large notice box backgrounds are now positioned on the right so text is easier to read 
    * Quick Start tab now hidden to avoid confusion with new Easy CSV Importer tab which is designed for instant first time use
    * As above but for the plugins pages
    * Persistent notices has been taking a step further. Soon we will see notices that we must manually delete. They will be used to deliver priority information and ensure the user gets it. We may also add notices when a feature changes and include a little warning about how the changes may effect existing projects etc. 
    * Public settings array is no longer being used and will no longer be part of the installation
* Technical Changes
    * Script used by CSV 2 POST admin pages is not only loaded when on a CSV 2 POST page, avoiding conflicts with other plugins and Wordpress. New function csv2post_is_plugin_page() part of the process starting in csv2post.php
    * Seperator and enclosure values added to fputcsv() function for log file creation. There is an issue where log file display does not display the last value and I'm hoping it corrects that issue.
    * $conf['fields'] is now populated with a count() of the log files headers + 1 for the date column which is default. Previously it was set to 10 and overlooping, never caused any known issues though.
    * Changed 'Line' to 'Code Line' for automation.csv to prevent mistaking it for the row line in CSV file.
    * New values added to many tabs in tab menu array ($csv2post_mpt_arr) for permissions (WP capability). Some do not have the new value (['permissions']['defaultcapability']) as a default admin role capability will be applied to all screens.
    * csv2post_load_admin_arrays.php renamed to csv2post_load_arrays.php and now loads log file array on public and admin side
    * New csv2post_STRINGS_is_alphanumeric() function for validating staff numbers
    * New csv2post_WP_SETTINGS_get_page_capability() function for returning a pages required capability for user to access the page
    * $csv2post_mpt_arr[PAGENAME]['role'] no longer in use, replaced with permissions values
    * Deleted csv2post_get_option()
    * $menu_id in Screen Permissions panel is incremented when a menu is added rather than for each screen in loop. This is to allow the total menu count to be used to loop through $_POST submission.
    * contents of csv2post_load_initialplugin_configuration.php move to the main file and this file deleted
    * csv2post_get_option_adminsettings() uses global $csv2post_adm_set and returns that global if option record not valid. The global should come from the included array file.#
    * csv2post_install_optionstatus_list() now checks if option values are valid, not just that the options are installed
    * New function csv2post_get_option_tabmenu(): checks admin setting to allowing loading from option record or from file, calls installation file if option should be valid but is not
    * New function csv2post_get_option_adminsettings(): installs admin option record if it is invalid in any way
    * csv2post_page_show_hide() function moved to csv2post_core_functions.php from csv2post_variables_tabmenu_array.php
    * LOAD EXTENSION CONFIGURATION now happens after LOAD OPTION RECORD VALUES so that the extension can change the loaded option record values
    * JavaScript is loaded differently, as recommended by Wordpress by making use of "admin_init"
    * Removed all use of csv2post_get_option_publicset() and the function itself. We will have one settings array, now the admin array. We can use a public node within that.
    * New function csv2post_persistentnotice_output() has been placed in three location types: pages, screens and panels. The function will filter notifications and allow persistent notices to be displayed within specific panels, the head of specific screens, the head of specific pages or display on all pages if urgent.
    * Tab menu array is no longer installed manually, removing a notice from the installation results which simply confirms the record already exists    
    * csv2post_php_version_check_wp_die() function delete and no longer called in csv2post.com
    * The use of csv2post_insert_post_contenttemplate() in csv2post_form_save_contenttemplate() has been changed to pass values where previously the function was expecting $_POST values                                                                   
    * Database table named csv2post_freeproject is always put through a DROP query when creating data import project
    * Function csv2post_display_categories_menu() moved from a projects screen file to the admin interface functions file 
    * Option record csv2post_installedversion is now created using add_option() rather than update_option(). We will now update it during an upgrade process which the user will be prompted to complete.
    
= 6.7.3 =
* From The Developers
    * Next big patch is expected to be released in January 
* Fixes
    * Fix in notifications function csv2post_get_option_persistentnotifications_array()
    * Fix in notifications function csv2post_n()
    * Fixed problem that happened when some tabs/screens on a page were hidden (plugins loop was still coded to expect all tabs due to the loop incrementing the tab ID)
* Feature Changes
    * Dialogue on clicking form Submit buttons can now be hidden (new option on Interface Settings screen)
    * Persistent notifications are now coming into play. These will require the user to indicate they have been read. Two methods, a settings panel listing current notifications and a link on the notification.
    * Panels are open by default: should a user have a javascript conflict they will still be able to access panels
    * New log file created 'automation.csv', will be used to log Schedule events and their outcomes plus any functions called using add_action()
* Support Changes
    * 
* Technical Changes
    * Extension loading now loads variable file first
    * Moved code in panel function csv2post_panel_header() so that global panel state is taking into consideration after the individual panel state
    * Panel state can be set by passing open or closed in ['panel_state']
    * Replaced all use of $counttabs in menu functions (incremented integer inside loop), arrays are now accessed using $tab (key value) set by the for itself
    * $csv2post_panels_closed no longer in use (removed from main file)
    * csv2post_hidden_form_values() function removed from csv2post_jqueryform_singleaction_middle(), the function should be within the panel code in screen file.
    * The order of functions in panels for form and jQuery dialog has been changed on ALL panels. This is a plugin wide change to apply the ability to disable the dialog feature.
    * New file for functions related to deciding setting states i.e. functions will return a default where a setting is not stored as we do not set all setting values straight away as a measure to use less memory
    * csv2post_WP_SETTINGS_panel_array() added to all panels for initializing $panel_array (3 lines removed from each panel making it a little easier to understand the array also)

= 6.7.2 =
* Public Messages
    * Re-installation of the csv2post_schedule option for Schedule System required when upgrading to this version
* Fixes
    * The new logging system had a bug effecting the creation of log files
    * csv2post_install() used maybe_serialize() for installing schedule array but the serialize function is not loaded by Wordpress, replaced it with serialize() instead
    * Schedule array record was being re-installed during Partial Un-Install because the schedule system would run during submission. From now on the schedule will not be processed during form submissions both public and admin side.
    * Errors when plugin attempts to make log entries during installation, this is no longer done so these errors will no longer show (would only been seen with debug mode on)
* Feature Changes
    * Removed "Backup Old Content" settings on the Update Options screen
    * Schedule array now part of installation (done so we can set post updating to on by default)
    * All settings on the Update Options screen are on by default (post updating will be more active without the user having to visit settings)
    * "CSV 2 POST Install" will now show as "Install/Uninstall"
* Support Changes
    * Updated page explaining why rows are dropped
    * Fixed links in notices displayed after importing data  
    * Extended text on the Post Content Updating Settings 
* Technical Changes
    * $csv2post_twitter variable no longer in use, all instances of it deleted and replaced with 'CSV2POST' which is the plugins Twitter account
    * add_action('the_posts', 'csv2post_posts_autoupdate' ) removed from the schedule for postupdating, it appears to be called at all times from main file anyway
    * csv2post_posts_autoupdate() renamed to csv2post_posts_publicupdating() (this function updates posts as they are opened by visitors)
    * Removed use of csv2post_log from csv2post_install_functions.php
    * Added index.php to all directories to prevent indexing
    * New updating method by schedule that uses new values in $csv2post_projectlist_array to indicate if a project may have outdated posts
    * New function csv2post_project_changed($project_code) used to mark a project has updated within $csv2post_projectlist_array
    * Changed $.csv2post_schedule_array, each event type now stores the event name and we'll use this for looping and building forms
    * csv2post_notice() was coded to update schedule option record instead of notifications option record, however it has never happened as its not fully in use
    * Use of csv2post_uninstall() removed from csv2post_install(), we will track the versions of records eventually to ensure installation is suitable for plugin version
    * csv2post_schedule_array..php is only included when needed (install and get_option function)
    * add_option('csv2post_theme','start') is now performed during install but no output
    * Use of var_dump() replaced with csv2post_var_dump() throughout plugin. csv2post_var_dump() is only to be used for permanent dumps, var_dump() is for during development only, this approach allows us to locate the use of var_dump() and remove.
    * All use of add_option() replaced with csv2post_option() which is new and does add,update and delete. It will allow us to log install related changes easier.
    
= 6.7.1 =
* Public Messages
    * We reached 10,000 downloads this week!
    * CSV 2 POST Twitter will notify you have new versions and important changes https://twitter.com/CSV2POST
* Fixes
    * A fix in data updating applied
    * Using the same CSV file for two or more data import jobs would break the Basic Import screen due to JavaScript ID's not being unique (using filenames, they now use job code)
    * Ultimate Taxonomy Manager: csv2post_form_save_ultimatetaxonomymanager_categories() function fixed thanks to Albert
    * Encoding Settings: missing line in form processing function so form was not being saved
    * Admin Triggered Automation: was not being saved
    * Basic SEO: saving the settings did not work, caused by Ryan and fixed by Ryan, again. Sorry folks.
    * Create Posts screen submission no longer conflict when there are multiple projects
    * Submitting a project with no entry in the project name field no longer creates a blank project
    * Table to Table MySQL queries improved
* Feature Changes
    * New Data History screen added to the Your Data page (by default it will display the latest 100 entries in descending order)
    * New Data Samples: the Created Tables screen now has a panel for each Data Import Job table which lists some records for the table. A tool for quickly confirming the existence of records, handy for us accessing users blogs and knowing they have imported records when we do not have access to phpmyadmin.
    * Reporting Settings: new panel offering ability to disable all logging and set the maximum size of log files
    * Two new log files: posts and data. We want to focus on these two new log files and get building a usable history of the plugins main purpose 
    * Log Files: dialog boxes are no longer used to confirm form submission outcome when creating, delete or activating log files
    * Removed Critical Options panel from the Install Status screen, it never really had much use for the average user
    * Moved Log File Status panel up to make it easier for users to find and manage the files
    * Extensions: the main file now checks for an existing active extension if the plugin has never been installed, rather than requiring the extension status setting to be active. This allows the menu to display the extensions name straight away where previously it would still say CSV 2 POST
    * Renamed the Created Database Tables List to Delete Job Tables
    * We can now edit data using phpmyadmin to trigger updating on a post for the record we edit without also having to edit the csv2post_updated column, this will happen automatically (done by MySQL)
    * Log file is activated straight after creating them using Log File Status panel reducing number of submissions required
    * Log file is disabled within settings when user deletes the file using File Status Panel. We have autodelete to prevent log files getting too large so we will use manual delete to also disable the logging. 
* Support Changes
    * None   
* Technical Changes
    * csv2post_log() is now csv2post_log() and moved to wtgcore_reports.php
    * New range of csv2post_log_#####() functions created, one for each log type and each has parameters suiting the type
    * Moved csv2post_log() and all other log related functions to wtgcore_reports.php (in the new core folder)  
    * csv2post_notice() functions renamed to csv2post_notice() and moved to wtgcore_reports.php
    * Range of new csv2post_notice() functions to make it easier for applying a standard to the most common uses of notice boxes i.e. form submission, in panels and at the top of screens 
    * csv2post_templatefiles_missing() removed from main file to help increase performance
    * csv2post_WP_SQL_create_dataimportjob_table() changed so that csv2post_updated column updates on manual edit
    * csv2post_activate_logfile() no longer returns value and log file activation (form processing) no longer requires it
    * csv2post_WP_SQL_query_rowid_exists() now returns csv2post_id value and not the CSV file row ID value
    * csv2post_load_admin_arrays_templatesystem.php renamed to csv2post_load_admin_arrays.php
    * New file csv2post_logfile_array.php (log files will have their own headers which are stored in the $csv2post_logfile_array)
    * Log system now allows us to easily create custom logs for different purposes (more important for ideas we coming much later)
    * csv2post_data_prep_fromcsvfile_advanced() created, new use of the data prep function is for our first extension which is still being worked on
    
= 6.7.0 =
* Public Messages
    * Status page may temporary show as CSV 2 POST Install.
    * This versions changes are very technical. A lot of new functions have been added for two new systems; Table to Table data transfer and Extension (like modules) system 
* Fixes
    * Warning on csv2post_tab1_pagedata.php on line 152 fixed
    * Warning on csv2post_tab8_pagedata.php on line 13 fixed 
    * Added missing echo in csv2post_menu_csvfiles() function
    * Basic SEO panel was not saving (somehow the function handling the form submission had been deleted!)
    * Updating a single post using the post ID would fail in some circumstances
* General Changes
    * Manual post update using post ID: improvements made which do more checks to ensure project is in ready state and csv2post_WP_SQL_get_posts_record() improved, fixing a bug.
    * Encoding Settings panel added to the General Settings screen (testing only for now)
    * General Settings tab is displayed again on the Main page
    * New Schedule Settings tab on the Main page and panels moved from Schedule screen on Creation page to this new one (Main page focusing on initial setup as many users are missing these options)
    * Extension panel added to the General Settings screen, one setting allowing us to disable/enable use extensions 
    * Advanced Import Screen: options to continue initial import or reset progress counters to force manual updating
    * New tab added to Your Data page named Table to Table, it is used to transfer data from one table to another. The interface allows us to pair columns between the two tables.
    * Select Table Setup on the Create Data Import Jobs panel removed, this will be handled in another way. All data import jobs will begin with a new table and a transfer from that table to another table will take place. The tools to do that will come after the Data Import Job is setup.
    * Help URL values removed from menu array in csv2post_variables_tabmenu_array.php to make the array smaller
    * csv2post.php is more organised, planning to reduce number of variables in use slightly and number of core files
    * Function for building menu is more dynamic, now loops through menu array, this is a required change for extension ability
    * Extension system built into the plugin, a template extension will be provided later (extensions re-configure plugins menus and can display custom screens while hiding other CSV 2 POST screens)
    * New screen on Main page named Configuration Settings, settings that change how the plugin operates i.e. allow extensions or not
    * Server Status screen has new panel displaying Wordpress configuration values, the first shown are Blog and Database charset (first change towards preparing better encoding options)
    * New panel on General Settings named Admin Triggered Automation: the ability to perform actions while working on the plugins pages. The first ability is checking CSV files for updates which will happen constantly when active and while logged in. The purpose of this is to force events while we are actually working with the plugin which makes it easier to test everything. The theory is, if it works while logged in, it will work while logged out and will be triggered by the schedule system.
* Support Changes
    * No website support changes (ticket system,download area and more planned) 
* Technical Information
    * Function csv2post_include_form_processing_php() now requires user to be logged in and $_POST['csv2post_post_processing_required'] to be set. It includes csv2post_form_processing.php which is admin side only. Public side $_POST processing is done using approaches specific to the form submitted.
    * Variable used to skip form processing functions ($cont) moved out of csv2post_form_processing.php to the csv2post_core_functions.php file inside csv2post_include_form_processing_php() function.
    * initialise core admin only variables moved outside of the is_admin() argument for ease of access by custom extensions
    * WTG_C2P_PLUGINTITLE constant changed to a variable
    * csv2post_load_templatesystem_constants.php is being removed from package, contents moved to csv2post.php
    * Two different functions with the same purpose: csv2post_form_submission_processing() deleted, csv2post_include_form_processing_php() is the one in use
    * Tab menu array option is no longer in the option record array, this avoids problems when user deletes menu array in order to reset it
    * Removed $record_id variable and related argument from csv2post_data_import_from_csvfile_basic() as it is meant for the advanced version of this function
    * csv2post_get_option_publicset(): function unserialize() changed to maybe_unserialize()
    * csv2post_menu_tablecolumns(): new $id parameter added to facilitate use of the function in csv2post_tabletotable_list_column_menus() where a list of menus is created
    * ['active'] value in $csv2post_mpt_arr for screens is now coming into use, use it to disable screens (hides the tab also)
    * Removed csv2post_update_currentproject_array() function, it is empty and not in use
    * New folder added named "wtgcore", we are starting a library of Wordpress suitable functions for all of our plugins (we have many planned for the next few years but focusing on building foundations right now)
    * Removed ['name'] value from tab menu array, it was never used
    * We can now name screen files something unique i.e. "csv2post_schedulesettings.php" rather than csv2post_tab4_creation.php
    * Tab Menu Array: the ['active'] feature is now in use for all pages and csv2post._admin_menu() adapted for it
    * csv2post_date() can now be used to return a giving time value as formatted date
    * Tab Menu: a big change to the tab menu array $csv2post_mpt_arr. All tabs now have the ['path'] value and it is always used. We can use it to point to any file on the server. This approach initially came about in our first extension.
    * csv2post_data_prep() function added to csv2post_WP_SQL_update_record(), all imported data will go through csv2post_data_prep()
