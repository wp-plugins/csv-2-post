Wordpress CSV Importer

== Description ==

Wordpress CSV Importer and data management plugin new for 2012.

= Versus Other Imports =
Wordpress CSV Importer offers a stand-alone solution for data importing and management. We are only just at the
beginning of what we plan to offer in July 2012. If you are a developer or wish to hire a developer to work with
this plugin on your blog, you will be happy to know that it is easy to customize.

Please seek support by creating a ticket here on the [forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-csv-importer/)

The plugin is supported by a dedicated team of developers who have worked on Wordpress for many years. It will
also get its own website soon, offering documentation and tutorial videos.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When was Wordpress CSV Importer Beta released? =
This plugins development begun at the end of 2011 and the Beta was released June 2012.

= Is Wordpress CSV Importer well supported? =
Yes, the plugin will be supported for many years and will soon have dedicated website.

= Will you make changes to the plugin to suit my needs? =
We note every request on a "To Do" list and we intend to keep working through the list
every week. If your needs are more urgent we can be hired. It is mainly Ryan Bayne who 
handles the more intense requests when clients have deadlines, something we take very 
serious. 

= Will development continue for this plugin? =
Our To Do list for Wordpress CSV Importer is already extensive. Ideas, requests and
requirements for data management are endless and we intend to meet demands.

= Why does the plugin no longer have post creation? =
The plugins old domain included "wordpress" which is not permitted as Wordpress is a 
trademark. Wordpress CSV Importer (post creation edition) is a very new plugin. So
while it is still new we decide to not just change our domain as required but to change
the plugins name also. Then we essentially edited Wordpress CSV Importer so that it was only
left with features related to data management. This may be problematic for some users at first
but in the long run it is far better. Branding is more obvious and it was always our plans to
release more plugins anyway. Now we have a plugin that will focus on data management which is no
bad thing at all.

== Screenshots ==

1. Start by creating a Data Import Job and import your CSV files data to a new database table created by Wordpress CSV Importer. We have the potential here to import to existing tables and more.
