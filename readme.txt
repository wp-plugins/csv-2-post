= About Our Plugin =
CSV importer plugin for Wordpress. CSV 2 POST Data Engine has been designed for businesses and developers working with a lot 
of data. Our WP plugin is a web tool for auto-blogging and managing imported data professionally. CSV 2 POST offers abilities
no other plugin offers and has offered some features for the first time before any other plugin did. This includes importing
two or more CSV files in one project and using data from each file to build posts. The plugin is provided by WebTechGlobal
who continue to develop and support it. So by installing CSV 2 POST today and contacting us we gaurantee you'll make progress. 

= Support =
The plugin is supported by a dedicated website at [www.webtechglobal.co.uk](http://www.webtechglobal.co.uk/). Most online support content is free. We
provide a higher level of priority to premium users. We recommend free users use the plugins forum on Wordpress.org and paid users email us.

= Our Mission =
It is very important to us that we deliver a useful free plugin for the Wordpress community to use and not
deliver software that behaves like a trial in order to advertise our paid edition. To ensure we do not make that
mistake as we have done before, we encourage all potential customers who email us to try the free edition, unless
thier project is unique and requires changes to the plugin. Development for CSV 2 POST will continue past 2014 and 
the plugin core will be shared with other plugins which will push CSV 2 POST further than other importers.

Yes

= Does this plugin work with SEO by Yoast plugin? =

the most popular get some extra support to make it easier for users. That includes All In One SEO 
and we will add the extra support for any other plugins on request.

= Will you make changes to the plugin to suit my needs? =
We note every request on a "To Do" list and we intend to keep working through the list
every week. If your needs are more urgent we can be hired. It is mainly Ryan Bayne who 
handles the more complex requests. However sometimes we can add a new feature to the free
edition quickly so please push for the free option first.

= Will development continue for this plugin? =
Yes. We hope to be adding new features until 2015 and updating it for compatability with Wordpress for many years.

== Screenshots ==

1. Start by creating a Data Import Job and import your CSV files data to a new database table created by CSV 2 POST. We have the potential here to import to existing tables and more.
2. Create templates for placing your data into post content. Templates are stored under a custom post type so many templates can be created. This gives us the potential to apply different designs based on specific conditions.
3. You can even create title templates, so you do not need pre-made titles, just suitable columns of data to create a title string from. These templates are stored under a custom post type.
4. Set the type of posts you want to create. Many plugins and themes will require you to create a different type of post, something CSV 2 POST will do easily.
5. This screenshot shows "Basic Custom Field Rules", paid edition has advanced features but most users require the basic form which allows you to create post meta with any data.
6. You can use up to 3 columns of data to create 3 levels of categories.
