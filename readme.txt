CSV 2 POST Version 8 by Ryan Bayne

== Description ==

Lets turn data into websites! CSV 2 POST for Wordpress can import any .csv file (only requirement is MySQL ready headers, basically no special characters allowed) then autoblog the data into hundreds or even thousands of well designed WP posts. My CSV importer plugin creates custom fields, categories and meta. If your new to Wordpress those are some of the elements that make up a web page in WP. CSV 2 POST is the first plugin to import data to a custom database table allowing the data to be prepared and other more advanced steps during the autoblogging procedure. Combine that with the power of Wordpress and there is no limit to how many high quality websites you can create using any data.

== Installation ==

1. You can place the csv-2-post folder in the plugins directory using FTP
1. You can also upload the plugin using Wordpress plugin screen (wp-admin/plugin-install.php)
1. If your Wordpress installation is on a path that includes "csv2post" it will trigger debugging to activate. This is meant for localhost development and can be disabled.
1. Your CSV file should be uploaded using FTP or Wordpress itself. Submit the path to CSV 2 POST, CSV 2 POST does not handle the upload. I have left this independent because there is security to consider for a lot of .csv files and the user should decide where best to store the file.
1. Please ensure wherever your .csv file is stored that Wordpress has permission to access the folder and file. Permissions can be changed in your hosting control panel for a directory. Developer software such as PhpED also allows it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I import CommissionJunction affiliate feeds? =
Firstly let me be clear that CSV 2 POST works with .csv files only. WebTechGlobal will be releasing other types of importers in time.
CSV files downloaded from C.J. affiliate network work great with this data importer plugin.

= Is there a limit to the number of posts I can create? =
No there are no limits anywhere. Let me know a plugin that has a limit for no reason other than generating premium sales and I'll
go to its page and rate it 1 star! 

= Will CSV 2 POST help me with SEO? = 
Yes CSV 2 POST includes features that makes good SEO easier to achieve. Version 8 of the free edition now allows unlimited number of
custom fields which can have very unique values designed using the WYSIWYG editor. It works in the same way as post title and post content.
Multiple columns of data can be inserted to create unique strings of text or even entire paragraphs.

= Why does the free editon have help text that only applies to premium edition? =
This is slowly being cleaned up. Some text is left in because it explains thing that helps users to understand how Wordpress works. Even
if it is based on a premium feature I hope it still helps someone. I welcome any requests to remove further mentions of a paid edition at
anytime. 

= Why are most videos based on the premium editions interface? =
Well as you can imaging creating and editing videos is time consuming. As features change videos need re-made so it is a constant job.
Most videos will cover all features in the free edition even if it takes a little longer because it has to cover options or procedures
only in the paid edition. However I'm more than happy to create YouTube tutorials on request.

= When was CSV 2 POST released? =
The project started in 2009 and was quickly backed by large businesses including Ryanair Ltd. I created the plugin while technically still at University so
it didn't take long for a re-development to happen. I found myself re-developing it again in 2014 with the aim of making more use of the Wordpress core. Version
8.0.0 should be the last big update of this free plugin which has been designed based on years of feedback. The premium will continue to expand.

= Is CSV 2 POST just like any-other .csv file importer for Wordpress? =

Not at all because CSV 2 POST has been created for advanced users, especially developers. Someone once referred to it as a Data Engine
and I'm going to coin that phrase in another plugin instead. Most of these importers do the same things,
they just do it in a slightly different way. CSV 2 POST initially importers data in a much different way because it imports the data to
a custom table before creating posts with it. There is endless reasons for this step which I won't go into.
Most differences between data importers comes down to the interface and what standard Wordpress GUI related features have been held back to boost a
premium edition. CSV 2 POST free edition offers reasonable functionality for a free software that has the technical job of working with
data. The interface looks and feels like Wordpress, with a couple of my own touches to improve user experience as do most of these 
importers. What makes CSV 2 POST advanced is not just the ability to auto-blog using almost any .csv file but but it has features and
functionality created to support growth. The user interface has been designed to expand easily so that we can quickly add new features
as your website needs them. I put a system
in place that easily allows new HTML forms and their PHP processing functions to be added. I can create a new form that is fully
processed on submission, in about 2 minutes. I can teach how in about 2 minutes also!

= Is CSV 2 POST better than any other .csv file importer on Wordpress? =

If I said CSV 2 POST is "better" than any plugin of its kind on Wordpress it would simply be my opinion and a bias one at that. 
So lets be realistic and honest. Not the usual marketing strategy to get someone using a product. That is because I'm a developer and
my job is to consider the user who has already downloaded my software, has it installed and wants to see results. I consider your needs,
your preferences, your Wordpress knowledge, your desired blogging quality and what your business requires. Yet it's not possible to get
that right because I've never met you to know your exact needs! You can bet most data importers for Wordpress are designed to do all the 
common and usual stuff. So I designed something different: a flexible plugin that I can configure on request, quickly and
cheaply. 

= What makes CSV 2 POST different from other importers? =

A great interface like no other importer, possibly like no other plugin. The UI feels and looks like Wordpress in most ways. The same
cannot be said about all plugins. The way the plugin operates is careful and requires more steps than other importers. Some developers seem
to think users don't like submitting too many forms. I have professional people in mind when I create my software not monkeys and in my
experience pro's won't let a few extra form submissions get in their way! There is a lot of validation and
re-validation in CSV 2 POST to ensure everything is configured correctly. It means there is a little more help text to read, a few more
videos to watch...maybe! Is that a bad thing, maybe for some. But I believe in it. That right there might be a difference, the author
believing in the software. CSV 2 POST was created by one man where most other importers are created by many people. Do they create the
software to increase their quality of life or do they feel passsionate about working with data in Wordpress as I do?
I feel it begins with the developer because it is a package: developer & software. A key difference between CSV 2 POST and other
importers is the lack of cheap marketing one-liners or bold "Upgrade Now" buttons on the plugins interface. If for you it begins
with the marketing techniques seen on other authors websites i.e. the "blog in 5 minutes" claim or the "earn money using
affiliate data". Then your welcome to create posts in 5 minutes using CSV 2 POST it's so easy. I invite you blog affiliate data
to make money and it is possible. I'm just not the WP plugin author that will lead you on in that way to get a sale myself. I'm
not marketing my free or premium edition on hopes and expections. I wouldn't feel good about my Paypal account balance increasing
because someone actually thinks making money online is THAT quick and easy. So one of the differences is that when you contact
me I'll give it to you straight as a developer. When you use my free edition my business won't be in your face, trying to generate a sale
from you.
