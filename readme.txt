Inject any CSV file data into the WordPress database as new Posts!

== Description ==

I used this plugin to create 1 million new WordPress posts in a matter of hours! I injected rows upon rows of affiliate data
from CSV files with ease. I didn't have to edit the CSV column headings or delete columns, no CSV file editing at all! Not
only that, the SEO for each post includes meta keywords and description in custom fields for HeadSpace2.

== Installation ==

No coding skills required to use this plugin and you can install as you would most plugins.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the CSV file processed all at once? =

You have the option of doing it all at once or staggering it so that a few rows are processed for each page load on your blog!
