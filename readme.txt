* More "post parts" added aimed at accomodating book data i.e. Author and publisher added
* Database upate script changed again, version 0.4. does not do database update however it is not crucial at this time

= 0.6 =
* This version was to correct an issue in repository only.

= 0.7 =
* Only the csv file name is required to be entered in Stage 1 when linking to a local file however you must upload your csv file to the CSV 2 POST plugin directory and put it in the "csv_files" folder.
* Stage 1 instructions amended to suit the new changes.
* Add file size limit indicator on stage 1 for file upload option. It is done dynamically using this: <?php $filelimit = ini_get( "upload_max_filesize"); echo $filelimit.' file size limit.'; ?>

= 0.8 =
* Fixed problem with duplicated posts.
* Recoded some of the create new campaign script.
* All csv files must be in the 'csv_files' folder now

= 0.9 =
* Recoding for version 0.8 caused a lot of issues and they have been resolve. Testing shows the plugin to be working well.
* Issue with "Written By" and "Published By" text showing up even when they are not required has been fixed.

= 1.0 =
* Full processing is limited by server memory, clear warnings now displayed regarding this and recommendation for localhost use only.
* Limited running campaigns to one at a time as two or more was causing conflicts. Later scheduling will be in place to automatically start paused campaigns.
* Extra duplication check to prevent duplicate posts when multiple hits are experianced. Quality, not quantity!
* Category filtering fixed, small variable change during version 0.9 work that caused this.
* Fixed problem when you select staggered and upload together, another variable change from version 0.9 and missed by me.
* You can now totally delete campaigns in campaign management. Multiple users asked for this.
* Set Post/Visit ratio to 1! A premium version will be available that will continue to be developed, donations will add to the free edition so please buy or donate.

= 1.1 =
* Moved processing trigger from footer based to header (wp instead of shutdown for developers). This helps to prevent loops and conflicts with other plugins.
* Added tags so SEO is not 100% covered.
* Fixed issue with some posts being created as Uncategorised!
* Finally I realised that my repository software will not prevent the csv_files folder being deleted on upgrade so instead the folder is not provided with the plugin. The plugin will now make the csv_files folder when it does not exist.

= 1.2 =
* Error as script attempted to creating "csv_files" folder even if it existed already.
* Repository or script changes to prevent "csv_files" folder being deleted does not work. If the folder does not exist in the plugin repository the upgrade deletes it to match. I still cannot find or get help for a solution and officially frustrated now after two weeks of trying lol
