CSV Import plugin developed by <a href="http://www.webtechglobal.co.uk/about" title="Visit WebTechGlobal Home">Ryan Bayne</a>.

<h3>SPECIAL OFFER</h3>
If you find a bug that no one else has reported on the WebTechGlobal Forum already and I can witness it or make it happen then you
will get CSV 2 POST Plus for half price.

<h3>ABOUT</h3>
CSV 2 POST quick install on WordPress is the free edition of this csv import tool. It is a great tool even as a trial plugin and can
import thousands of affiliate products from your affiliate feeds in a matter of minutes. The interface is unique and you DO NOT have
to edit your csv file to make it work with my scripts. The interface helps you connect csv columns to post parts, it does not 
assume your csv file is laid out in a specific way that I've set but instead you tell the plugin the order of your columns and what
each column is to be used for.

The paid edition of this plugin is aimed at those who import data as part of their job or longer term ambitions. It allows custom
layouts to be created and customisation can be applied easily for every customer. I offer this service free and will even help you
import the data if your short on time.

The paid edition also has far more control over SEO, Tags, Custom Fields, Categorising and general configuration.
