CSV 2 POST 8.0.0 by Ryan Bayne

== Description ==

CSV 2 POST has been around for years and has reached version 8.0.0 thanks to the support from users. Import data, work with your data, use your data to
create posts. This plugin will help you maximize the use of affiliate data, Wordpress core and your theme.  
 
= Installation ==

1. You can place the csv-2-post folder in the plugins directory using FTP
1. You can also upload the plugin using Wordpress plugin screen (wp-admin/plugin-install.php)
1. If your Wordpress installation is on a path that includes "csv2post" it will cause debugging to activate. This is handy for developers, not for anyone who doe not want to see Wordpress errors.
1. Your CSV file should be uploaded using FTP or Wordpress itself. Submit the path to CSV 2 POST, CSV 2 POST does not handle the upload. I have left this independent because there is security to consider for a lot of .csv files and the user should decide where best to store the file.
1. Please ensure wherever your .csv file is stored that Wordpress has permission to access the folder and file. Permissions can be changed in your hosting control panel for a directory. Developer software such as PhpED also allows it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When was CSV 2 POST released? =
The project started in 2009 and was quickly backed by large businesses including Ryanair Ltd. I created the plugin while technically still at University so
it didn't take long for a re-development to happen. I found myself re-developing it again in 2014 with the aim of making more use of the Wordpress core. Version
8.0.0 should be the last big update of this plugin which has been designed based on years of feedback.
