CSV 2 POST

== Description ==

CSV 2 POST is a growing box of tools for auto-blogging and managing imported data. 
Everything added to this plugin is at the request of users who know best including professionals developing true money 
making websites and even well known companies have made use of CSV 2 POST to help with administration. Those
include CBS News and Ryanair Ltd. They come to us because
other plugins which offer a step by step system and assume a lot about what the user wants done with their data
are simply not good enough. 

CSV 2 POST has been designed to out-perform other importers and we have done that with the help of the Wordpress
community who use them all. We include a step-by-step system like most (possibly all) other plugins available,
which takes users through the same process on every single use, every single website no matter what theme or plugins
we use. However our main interface is more of a workshop or a sandbox and in this sandbox are endless tools, some
are not obvious because it's hard putting them all on one interface without making it feel over complicated.

= Support = 
The plugin is supported by a dedicated
website at [www.csv2post.com](http://www.csv2post.com/). The interface offers a "Help" button beside every feature. A small hint 
is giving and users can click another button to open a page on www.csv2post.com specific to the feature
the user needs help for. Some pages will have video tutorials and screenshots. The online support content is free. We
also plan to create help content specifically for the free edition so that it is truly supported.

= Our Mission =
It is very important to us that we deliver a useful free plugin for the Wordpress community to use and not
deliver software that behaves like a trial in order to advertise our paid edition. To ensure we do not make that
mistake as we have done before, we encourage all potential customers who email us to try the free edition, unless
thier project is unique and requires changes to the plugin. We have a very long term plan for CSV 2 POST, both free 
and paid. Most of the time a new feature begins on the free edition and grows in the paid edition. This is how
we ensure full respect to Wordpress is giving. If you budget is tight just say

== Installation ==

Initial upload and activation as guided by Wordpress.org standard plugin installation.

1. Upload the `csv-2-post` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the CSV 2 POST plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin by going to the Settings screen
1. Always backup your database before mass creating posts unless working on a test blog
1. It is recommended you learn the plugin on a test blog first
1. Always seek support if a CSV file does not appear to work, it is usually something minor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with SEO by Yoast plugin? =
Yes it does, actually in a technical way all SEO plugins work with CSV 2 POST however
the most popular get some extra support to make it easier for users. That includes All In One SEO 
and we will add the extra support for any other plugins on request.

= Is CSV 2 POST well supported? =
Yes, the plugin will be supported for many years and has a dedicated website.

= Will you make changes to the plugin to suit my needs? =
We note every request on a "To Do" list and we intend to keep working through the list
every week. If your needs are more urgent we can be hired. It is mainly Ryan Bayne who 
handles the more complex requests. However sometimes we can add a new feature to the free
edition quickly so please push for the free option first.

= Will development continue for this plugin? =
Our To Do list for CSV 2 POST is already extensive. Ideas, requests and
requirements for new web technology will keep us busy until 2014. This is why the plugins
interface has so many screens and offers the ability to hide features not wanted. 

= Why are the features on so many different plugin screens? =
Long term plans for the development of CSV 2 POST will add an endless list
of new features. Not only do all the form fields and buttons need to be tidy but
every feature and ability has to be offered without assumption. Meaning users
must be able to configure them or opt out of using them or use defaults. Users have that
choice and flexability which is not offered in all plugins. The entire plugin offers a 
sandbox approach, especially for those who know a little PHP and can customise it even
further. The sandbox approach assumes nothing and is expressed on an interface that does
not push users through a linear step by step process.

= When was CSV 2 POST Beta released? =
This plugins re-development begun at the end of 2011 and the Beta was released June 2012. However the
first plugin was created in 2009 and was halted pending re-development.

== Screenshots ==

1. Start by creating a Data Import Job and import your CSV files data to a new database table created by CSV 2 POST. We have the potential here to import to existing tables and more.
2. Create templates for placing your data into post content. Templates are stored under a custom post type so many templates can be created. This gives us the potential to apply different designs based on specific conditions.
3. You can even create title templates, so you do not need pre-made titles, just suitable columns of data to create a title string from. These templates are stored under a custom post type.
4. Set the type of posts you want to create. Many plugins and themes will require you to create a different type of post, something CSV 2 POST will do easily.
5. This screenshot shows "Basic Custom Field Rules", paid edition has advanced features but most users require the basic form which allows you to create post meta with any data.
6. You can use up to 3 columns of data to create 3 levels of categories.
