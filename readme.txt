ABOUT
CSV 2 POST quick install on WordPress is the free edition of this csv import tool. It is a great tool even as a trial plugin and can
import thousands of affiliate products from your affiliate feeds in a matter of minutes. The interface is unique and you DO NOT have
to edit your csv file to make it work with my scripts. The interface helps you connect csv columns to post parts, it does not 
assume your csv file is laid out in a specific way that I've set but instead you tell the plugin the order of your columns and what
each column is to be used for.
