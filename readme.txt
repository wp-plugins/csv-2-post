Inject any CSV file data into the WordPress database as new Posts!

== Description ==

Use CSV 2 POST to inject 1 million rows of csv file data in WordPress! It is free to use and has some cool features that other
similiar plugins don't. Users have commented that this can be a powerful plugin however it was originally developed when I finished
University in 2009 and for personal use only so there are bugs. It's popularity however requires many upgrades to bring it inline
with other plugins and WebTechGlobal will be working on these on a weekly basis during the rest of 2009. 

== Installation ==

No coding skills required to use this plugin and you can install as you would most plugins.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the CSV file processed all at once? =

You have the option of doing it all at once or staggering it so that a few rows are processed for each page load on your blog!
