CSV 2 POST is a very large project and it is important that the same approaches are used throughout the plugin. 
Wordpress standards are important to me sure but a plugin this advanced needs slight modifications that need to be continued
and not forgotten about as we repeat classes such as those that extend WP_Widget. It was creating a class to extend WP_Widget
that made me realize that I need snippets that are adapted for CSV 2 POST and need to be kept in mind. Another 20 widgets
will probably be created this year. Please use the snippets in this folder trusting that any modifications to them make them
more ready for use in CSV 2 POST, making customizing easier.
